# common-token-contract
An open source contract to make NFTs interoperable with the IRL world.  A global contract for NFTs.

**Description**  
This is an open source contract to make your non-fungible token (NFT) interoperable with the real world of lawyers, contracts, courts, and so on.  It hardens and clarifies the main terms between the creator of the NFT and future owners, and reduces that into a machine readable format (JSON) that can be stored on IPFS forever.

**Problem**  
When a new NFT is created, it's unclear what the exact property rights are in it.  Who owns the token?  What do they own - does it include copyright?  What about future sales?  If two parties have a disagreement they want to take off chain, how do they resolve it?
